# “math” is a module (= a file) containing a number of mathematical functions.
# The “import” statement instructs Python to “load” the module and make these functions available for
# use.

# How do we use functions in a module?
# There are three ways.

# 1. The way we just saw: This just makes the module available but we need to use the “dot” syntax to
# actually access the function.
# import math
# math.sqrt(9)

# 2. We can import a single function from a module. The function is then available to be used “directly”
# like the len() function.
# from math import sqrt
# sqrt(9)

# 3. We can import all the functions from a module at one time. We can then use the function name
# directly as in 2 above.
# from math import *
# sqrt(9)

# disdvantage would be spaces of name is will be increase if we use #3

# Functions
# def

# IMPORTANT: Terminology: The x any above are called parameters, the 3 and 4 are called
# arguments. The arguments can be constants as in the above example, or variables as in the examples
# below.
